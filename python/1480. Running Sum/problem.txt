Importing and Exporting
Entities can be imported and exported from Cloud Firestore. Exports contain entities but
not indexes. Those are rebuilt during import. Exporting requires a Cloud Storage bucket
to store the exported data. You can specify a filter when exporting so that only a subset of
entity kinds are exported.
Exported entities can be imported into BigQuery using the bq command, but only if
an entity filter was used when creating the export. There are a number of restrictions on
importing Cloud Firestore exports to BigQuery:
■■ The Cloud Storage URI of the export file must not have a wildcard.
■■ Data cannot be appended to an existing table with a defined schema.
■■ Entities in the export have a consistent schema.
■■ Any property value greater than 64 KB is truncated to 64 KB on export.
Cloud Firestore in Datastore Mode is a managed document database that is well suited
for applications that require semi-structured data but that do not require low-latency writes
(< 10 ms). When low-latency writes are needed, Bigtable is a better option.
